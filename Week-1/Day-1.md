Week-1, Day-1
===
   
   
We start coding camp with California State University Student   
I felt nervous because it was our first time meeting   
Questioning in English will be very good for improving my English and coding skills   
However, I are finding equilibrium because it can interfere with the progress of the class and others   
   
```

President of each university spoke about project   
honestly, our president's speach wasn't good   
He say about G7 and greatness of Korea   
And I can't understand the reason why it is needed to coding camp   
Anyway, Start wasn't worst.
